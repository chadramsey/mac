A simple auto clicker written in Java.

### Versions

Added a spacebar action. Adjusted some of the action intervals. Added key shortcuts for each action ('O' initiates/stops the left click action; 'P' initiates/stops the spacebar action).
#### [v0.1.0](https://github.com/chadramsey/mac/releases/tag/v0.1.0)
This is an initial release which will automate a 'left click' action every 1.5 seconds while running. A later release may include a slider or input dialog to allow for variable intervals to be entered.
